  After many years of doing very little drawing I was encouraged by my lovely
  wife to take a sketching course.  The course was presented by Mark Silvers, a
  local artist in Fort Collins. His approach was very informal and relaxed. We
  used pencils, inks, quills and brushes. During the class we was encouraged to
  try the technique of sketching quickly, with the emphasis on getting the
  sketch outline down as fast as we could, rather than focusing on the details.
  This technique was a major turning point for me and has really helped me to
  get back into enjoying art once again. One of the most surprising results is I
  now do landscapes (which I never did) and enjoying them too! I have also found
  ink very inspiring, because it's a very simple medium and quick to setup.  I
  often carry a sketch book around with me and instead of a pencil I use a
  waterproof ink pen, which requires a different mind set than pencil, each
  stroke needs to be confident, there is no going back, no erasing. The use of
  ink develops confidence and commitment.

Pastels are also very interesting to use although not easy they are very vibrant and quick.

### Art Work printing

Question: Are Giclee prints of my artwork are possible?

What I'm considering is to provide free high quality images that you can use to print.

You take the image and use it with a professional printer like and if you like what you get you can send a percentage of the cost to my paypal account.

I have used "Fine Print" before and had good results

If this interests you email me

I would also check the prices for 16x20 inches and 24x20 inches (Bamboo or Gallery Wrapped). 

There are cheeper options but my images are roughly this size and Bamboo is good for Frame mounting and Galley wrapped are good without a frame.

Below is a paypal link

As a background

Giclee printing is meant to produce a product at a   
higher quality and longer lifespan than a standard   
desktop inkjet printer.
